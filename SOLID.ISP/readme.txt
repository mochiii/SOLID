We have requirement to add TryParse method to IssueReportParser, extract interface and implement that interface by IssueReportParserImportantIssueFilter
so it can be used as decorator. IssueReportParserImportantIssueFilter does not require TryParse method but is pushed to implement it. Doing so we violate ISP.
