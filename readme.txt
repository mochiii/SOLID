Code samples demonstrating SOLID principles on toy examples.
These code samples are used as accompanying materials for presentation of the same name.
Presentation is meant for complete beginners so code samples were written as simple as author (me) could imagine.

OCP, LSP and ISP projects contain readme.txt with brief description of changes made to the project in order to demonstrate application of principles.

Pull requests with simplifications and cool ideas are welcome :)
